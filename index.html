        <caption>December 2015, Houston Galleria</caption>
        <img src="images/tesla.jpg" alt="tesla-galleria" width=200 height="auto">
        <p>Tesla was amazing. I worked part-time at the Houston Galleria, Houston's central mall. I talked to fanboys, skeptics of the local oil industry, and rich people. I evangelized the vision, Elon, and administered test drives (0-60 in 2.8 secs baby!).</p>
        <p>I got this job in a hilariously naive, freshman way.</p>
        <p>About a month into my undergrad degree, I went to the fall career fair. Wearing a preppy pastel outfit I brought from high school, I energetically went around shaking hands and asking what these companies did.</p>
        <p>After the career fair, several upperclassmen gave me shit for going around "networking" because these companies were obviously only looking for juniors and seniors.</p>
        <p>What they didn't realize was that Tesla was there, looking to staff part-time Product Specialists, and that this job really only had one responbility: enthusiastically talk to people about Tesla.</p>
        <p>What I didn't realize was that when I saw Tesla there, went up and nearly cried from fanboying so hard, was that that <i>was</i> the job. That's it. Done. Fin. That was the interview.</p>
        <p>For the rest of my freshman year, I went into our showroom 30 hours a week, rubbing shoulders with some of Houston's top brass (for context, Tesla at this time was still strictly high-end, pre Model 3 and Model X, and electric cars were especially edgy given Houston's identity as an oil town).</p>
        <p>But beyond these titans of industry, I also met so many interesting travelers. Being a starry-eyed freshman, I asked them for life advice, and they were more than happy to give it to me. One day I plan to write an anthology the wisdom they imparted to me.</p>

      <div>
        <h1>Microsoft</h1>
        <p>
          I write about my Microsft internship experience <a href="https://www.notion.so/tangjeff0/What-I-learned-interning-at-Microsoft-and-why-I-m-not-coming-back-867677035e574644ad621a3183f371ee">here</a> so I won't go into too much detail, but overall I did not love it.
        </p>
        <p>I think a big part of that has to do with the fact that internships at big companies are scoped narrowly and somewhat contrived (which makes sense). The project I would've returned to was actually interesting, but ultimately, the pace was too slow for me, the people too content.</p>
        <p>The salary and resume experience would've been nice, but our time on earth is finite.</p>

        <h1>Strata Labs</h1>
        <p>
          Strata is a micropayments started based in San Francisco and founded by two Harvard '18 CS grads.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined Strata as the first engineer, building out cloud infrastructure processes and ensuring reliability (DevOps and SRE).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I mastered the art of bash, setting up our CircleCI build/deploy/test pipeline.</li>
          <li>I migrated our fragmented npm modules into a single monorepo with lerna and yarn.</li>
          <li>I contributed to open source packages for the Interledger Network Protocol.</li>
          <li>I messed up a deploy once, nearly costing the company thousands of dollars. I scraped through petabytes of logs and luckily recovered the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I learned a lot about Kubernetes and system design, and my resourcefulness/autodidacticism had to level up, but being the first hire was ultimately a far greater lesson in leadership than engineering. Working with my founders was a helluva time, and I loved every second of it.

        <caption>June 2018, Santiago</caption>
        <p>
          GroupRaise is a marketplace startup based in both Houston and Santiago, Chile. I was fortunate enough to work in both offices, part-time in Houston my sophomore spring and then Santiago for a summer internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          At GroupRaise I dipped my toe in Ruby on Rails, generating dynamic SEO-optimized HTML for the 5,000+ businesses on our platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the SEM side, I used Google Adwords to create and optimize targeted ad campaigns.
        </p>


        <p>
          For both SEO and SEM, I researched keywords and demographic data, and used Google Analytics to track and evaluate these campaigns. Ultimately, I improved our core digital metrics across the board (CTR, CPM, CPC, CPA).
        </p>

        <p>
          GroupRaise is an alum of Startup Chile and TechStars, and has raised venture funding from Kapor Capital. GroupRaise is an impact venture that helps non-profits raise money, and has a majority minority team.

        <img src="images/ken.jpg" alt="ken" height="auto" width=300 />
        <caption>December 2018, Houston</caption>
        <p>When I was first learning about digital marketing over my sophomore winter break, I decided the best way to prove my understanding was not with the dumb Google Adwords test, but with a real world project! I eventually deployed an ad campaign for my good friend Ken, a shoe shiner in Houston.</p>
        <p>I originally met Ken when I needed to get a shoe shined while working at Tesla. I was immediately drawn to this kind, humble man.</p>
        <p>I found Ken through Yelp, but I told him he would probably get a lot more business if he was on Google Maps as well.</p>
        <p>So I put him on the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=kens+shoe+shin&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#lrd=0x8640c104e3605541:0x4347c33bb089a74f,1,,,">map!</a></p>
        <p>A year later, I later setup some Google Ads for Ken to test out my skills (he got a lot more business).</p>
        <p>And a year after that, after learning how to make web apps, I made Ken a <a href="http://www.kensshine.com">website!</a>. If you're ever in Houston and need a shine, you know who to call :)</p>
